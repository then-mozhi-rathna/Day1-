*Objects, in javascript, is it's most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern javascript.  These objects are quite different from javasript's primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
*Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
*An object, is a reference data type.
    Variable that are assigned a reference or a pointer to that value.  That reference or pointer poits to the location in memeory where the object is stored.  The variables don't actually store the value.
*Loosely speaking, objects in javascript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of "key; value" pairs.  These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and method, respectively, in the context of an object.
*FOR EXAMPLE: If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, ets and methods like updateAddress, updateName, etc.
