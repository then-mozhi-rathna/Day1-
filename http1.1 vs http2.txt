
HTTP stands for hyper text transfer protocol, and it is thw basis for almost all web application.
more specifically, HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information.

WHAT IS HTTP/1.1?
    The first usable  version of HTTP was created in 1977.  Because it went through several stage of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1.  The version is still in use on the web.
WHAT IS HTTP/2?
    *In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.
    *HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipated.  In particulars, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
    *One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP/2 AND HTTP/1.1
     MULTIPLEXING:* HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.  
     *In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
     *HTTP/2 does this by splitting data into binary-code messages and numbering these message so that the client knows which stream each binary message belongs to.

     SERVER PISH: *Typically, a server only serves content to a client device if the client asks for it.  However, this approaches is not always pratical for modern webpages, which often involve several dozen separate resources that the client must request. 
     *HTTP/2 solves this problem by allowing a server to "push" content to a client before the client asks for it. 
     *The server also send a message letting the client knows What pushed content to expect-like if Bob had sent Alice a Table of Contents of his novel beforesending the whole thing.

     HEADER COMPRESSION:* Small files load more quikly than large ones. to speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP message to make them smaller.
     *However, HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets.  
     *This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP packets involve in loading even a single webpage, those bytes add up quikly, resulting in faster loading.
